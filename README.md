## Get Started
To create your own algorithm, copy the contents of `template.R` into a new R script and fill in the algorithm. Name the new file `yourname.R` and save it in the same directory as this file.

> IMPORTANT: Before running this script, run `init.R` to install the required packages

### Requirements
In order to run this script, you must have the following files/folders in the same directory:
- `dandelion_model`
- `original_photos`
- `script.R`

## Adding a New Algorithm
To add a new algorithm, copy the contents of `template.R` into a new R script and fill in the algorithm. Name the new file `yourname.R` and save it in the same directory as this file. Once you have done this, you can add your algorithm in the indicated area.

When you add a your algorithm, make sure it modifies the contents of the `dandelion_model` folder, **not** the `original_photos` folder. The `original_photos` folder should remain unchanged.

When you make your changes, upload **only** your individual file to the github repository, and leave the rest of the files unchanged.
